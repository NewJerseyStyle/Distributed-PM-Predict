# Distributed-PM-Predict
A fork of [Project-PM-Predict](https://github.com/NewJerseyStyle/Project-PM-Predict) but faster
crawling with distributed workers.

I will implement a Ray remote function for workers download data and analysis data.
I will implement a Python script to be packed with Pyinstaller to start worker node.
